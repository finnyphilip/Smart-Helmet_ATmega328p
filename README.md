# SMART HELMET

* The helmet unit consists of a gas sensor (MQ-3), a switch, an encoder (MT145026) and a transmitter.
* The vehicle unit consists of an ATMega328p microcontroller, LCD display, vibration sensor, GSM module, GPS module, receiver, motor controller, buzzer
and an LED bulb.
* The vehicle unit and helmet unit are paired with each
other wirelessly.

## Future Scope 
- Head-up display on the rider's helmet visor could be
implemented.
- More advanced 32 bit microcontroller can be used for
faster operation.
- The helmet could be paired with smartphone over
Bluetooth to provide real-time navigation through visor
display.
- A dedicated GUI and RTOS can be developed using a
32-bit microcontroller.
- Solar panels for powering the helmet
- High speed warning and more advanced SOS sending
system
- Another main feature that can be implemented is Rider
Drowsiness Detection System which helps to alert if a rider is
facing fatigue or not.
